# Space Invaders

![A gif of Space Invaders gameplay](https://raw.github.com/mrCamelCode/assets/main/space_invaders.gif)

A simple demo game made with [Thomas](https://github.com/mrCamelCode/thomas). In this game, you move around to dodge enemy bullets and send out your own to try to clear the enemies from the level! 

This game demonstrates simple concepts, like rendering and moving entities around based on logic and user input. Feel free to fork the repo and build on the game! Wouldn't it be cool if the player could have power ups?

Controls:
- Move: `A`, `D`
- Shoot: `Space`
